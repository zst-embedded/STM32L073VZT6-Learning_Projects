@par Demo Description

The provided demonstration firmware based on STM32Cube helps you to discover STM32 
Cortex-M devices that can be plugged on a STM32L073Z_EVAL board. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock
(SYSCLK) to run at 32 MHz (HSE + PLL).
 
 
Below you find the different items of demonstration :

 - Six icons are shown on the TFT LCD to propose the execution of 5 demonstrations + 1 help

 - LOW-POWER   : allows to enter in the low power modes(RUN, LPRUN, SLEEP, LPSLEEP, STOP, STANDBY) 
                 and the wakeup can be order by an EXTI or an alarm.
                 After wake-up, the current consumption measured by a companion chip (mfx) is displayed
 - THERMOMETER    : Displays the temperature (sensor Stlm75) in radiator thermostat way. Thanks to SMBUS,
                    a management of temperature setpoints tracking is done with interruption events which.
                    display messages and Min/Max temperature values.
                    - Requirements: the LCD glass(MB979) has to moved down in IO position on CN10 
                    and CN14 connectors for correct application behaviour.    
 - LPUART WAKE-UP : Demonstrates the wake-up of the platform from a terminal connected to CN7 (RS232)
                    in different modes. After wake-up, the current consumption measured by a companion
                     chip (mfx) during Stop mode is displayed.
                    - Requirements: a PC with hyperterminal software installed is needed and
                    correctly set according to instructions displayed on TFT screen (ie BaudRate = 9600,
                    Data = 7 bits, Parity = ODD, Stop = 1 bit, HwFlowCtl = NONE for recall).
                    Moreover, the LCD glass    (MB979) has to moved down in IO position on CN10 
                    and CN14 connectors. The jumper JP10 has to be moved on IDD position and
                    the jumper JP12 to +3V3 position for correct application behaviour.    

 - LC SENSOR METERING : This application shows how is managed the LC Sensor.Two modes are available : 
                        - Standard mode shows the LC sensor sensitivity to metal graphically on the display.
                        - Low Power mode minimizes power consumption of the detector to achieve years operation.
                        In both cases, metal strip must be placed over the LC sensor.  

 - PRESSURE  : Demonstrates the capability of ADC 16 bits oversampling mode from the ADC 12 bits available 
               in the STL32L073xx component. The current air pressure value is measured from the sensor (U1).
              
               - The first panel displays the curve of pressure = f(time).
               Each 200ms, a 12-bit A/D conversion is done and a black point is added.
               A 16-bit A/D conversion (oversampling) is also done and a red point is added.
               To modify the pressure, move up the board to 1.5 meters then move it down to the floor.

               - Press SEL to see the statistical distribution of 2 000 acqusitions 12-bit.
               The average value and the standard deviation are calculated for each series of measure.
               Min = average – standart deviation;
               Max = average + standart deviation;
               
               - Press SEL to see the statistical distribution of 2 000 acquisitions 16-bit (oversampling).
               The average value and the standard deviation are calculated for each series of measure.
               Min = average – standart deviation;
               Max = average + standart deviation;
               
               - Press SEL to display again the curve pressure = f(time).
               
               - Press DOWN at any time to exit the demo.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. 
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, 
      then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to
      1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L073Z_EVAL devices..
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L073Z_EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.      

  - A SDSC microSD card (capacity up to 4GB), must contain several.bmp files
    available under the FW package /Firmware/Utilities/Media/Pictures folder.


    Here is the list of the mandatory files which need to be copied into the SD card: 

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
     |  FW package files to copy                                 |  Location inside SD card files |
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     | /Utilities/Media/Pictures/BMP_64x64/Help.bmp     |  STFILES/Help.bmp                       |
     | /Utilities/Media/Pictures/BMP_64x64/LCsensor.bmp |  STFILES/LCsensor.bmp                   |
     | /Utilities/Media/Pictures/BMP_64x64/Power.bmp    |  STFILES/Power.bmp                      |
     | /Utilities/Media/Pictures/BMP_64x64/Pressure.bmp |  STFILES/Pressure.bmp                   |
     | /Utilities/Media/Pictures/BMP_64x64/Temp.bmp     |  STFILES/Temp.bmp                       |
     | /Utilities/Media/Pictures/BMP_64x64/Uart.bmp     |  STFILES/Uart.bmp                       |
     | /Utilities/Media/Pictures/BMP_128x160/STLogo.bmp |  STFILES/STLogo.bmp                     |  
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    To do these copies, you must create a /STFILES folder at SD card's root directory, and copy the 
    different bmp files as described in the above table. 
    
    
  - On STM32L073Z-EVAL-RevB, the jumpers must be configured as described
    in this section. Starting from the top left position up to the bottom 
    right position, the jumpers on the Board must be set as follow:

     CN2:     ADC_IN5     [On] 
     CN3:     DAC_OUT     [On]
     JP2:     DAC_OUT_Det [Right position]
     JP3:     BL_BOOT     [Off]
     JP4:     VDDA        [On]
     JP5:     VREF        [On]
     JP6:     BL_RST      [Off]

     JP18:                [Off]
     JP9:     USART       [Left position]
     CN8:     EXT_LC      [Off]
     JP16:    DetLCD_1    [Off]
     JP14:    DetLCD_2    [Off]
     JP11:                3th position (starting from the left) upon the 4 available
     JP10:    IDD         [Down position]
     JP12:    +3V3        [Up position]
     JP13:    Power_ext   [Off]

 - On STM32L073Z-EVAL-RevB, the LCDGlass must be put in IO position.
